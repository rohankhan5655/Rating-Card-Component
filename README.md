This project implements a star rating component inspired by Frontend Mentor's challenge. It goes beyond the basic functionality by providing several enhancements:

* **Enhanced User Experience:**
  * Clear and immediate visual feedback for user selections with CSS animations.
  * Informative error message if no rating is chosen, prompting the user to select a star.
  * Temporary display of the error message using a timeout for a seamless user experience.
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes and devices for optimal usability.
* **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML structure and appropriate ARIA attributes (to be implemented in future iterations) for accessibility considerations.

**Features:**

* Star-based rating selection.
* Dynamic display of the selected rating in the output section.
* Eye-catching CSS animations to highlight user interactions.
* Informative error message for missing selections.
* Responsive design for various screen sizes.

**Technologies Used:**
